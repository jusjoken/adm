== Plugin Compatibilities ==
=== General ===
  * any Plugin that modifies the Main Menus or their submenus may have issues and should be tested
  * I can add notes here for any reported issues, workarounds or succeses
  * If you need temporary access to a Menu that is missing then you can go to the ADM Manager and Disable ADM and the function should operate normally with the standard SageTV Menus
  
=== Diamond ===
  * see [#Diamond Notes]
=== MyTV ===
  * Should work with ADM disabled
  * ADM Enabled
    * Add a custom Submenu (2nd level menu) and specify the MyTV submenu as it's Sage Submenu
    * The Auto Open function will not work yet (perhaps in a future release)

== Diamond Notes ==
  * This plugin has been designed to work combined with Diamond if it is installed
  * Compatible with Diamond version 3.30

        * This is the menu you create and modify with Diamond tools (not a copy)

    * ADM will detect which of these 2 menus you have enabled in Diamond and set the opposite to be not Shown
    * You can manually edit either or both of the menus by setting the Show Menu Item property. you can show both if you want.

  * Replace videos with Diamond Movies
    * This function of Diamond will not affect the visibility of the Video or Movies menu item. You must set this manually within ADM Manager using the Show Menu Item property.
  * Hide Main Menu Items
    * This function of Diamond will not affect the visibility of the Main Menu items. You must set these manually within ADM Manager using the Show Menu Item property.
  * Future !ToDos to support Diamond
    * Launch specific Diamond Movie Custom flow - not yet available
    * Launch specific Diamond Custom TV view - not yet available
      * this function in Diamond actually uses the SageTV built in custom TV views - so once I add this function then this will be available for both Diamond and Standard SageTV
      
  
==Troubleshooting==
  * Loading Default Menus
    * go to the ADM Manager
