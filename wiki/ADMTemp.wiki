= Details =

== Changes in Version 0.42 ==

  * New Quick Launch Menu (QLM)
    * Optional new feature to display a menu on top of nearly any SageTV screen making the full ADM menu available quickly throught SageTV
    * With Diamond you can also optionally have the diamond Widgets displayed with the QLM
  * Updated Action management
    * Used when editing or creating Menu Items for the selection of the Action to perform
    * Simpler approach (I hope) to selecting and finding the appropriate action (from a list of 120 available actions)
    * Can be filtered by Music, TV, Video, etc
    * Filter can be set to "sticky" to be available for subsequent uses when creating/adusting multiple similar menu items
  * New Dynamic List Actions
    * These menu items will be replaced with a dynamic list of menu items when they are displayed in the menus
    * Available Types
      * Music Playlist - current list of Music Playlists
      * Video Playlist - current list of Video Playlists
      * TV Revordings - list of 4-8 recording views depending on your settings
      * Diamond Custom Flows - list of currently configured Diamond Custom Flows
  * New Malore Actions
    * Malore menu actions have been added/updated to work with the CopyMode 
    * New Malore Menu Actions are now available to jump directly to a specific Alternate View
  * Updated Default Menus
    * All menu items in the Default Menus are now ADM controllable menu items
    * Removed the use of any SageTV submenus from the default menus as they are less flexible
    * Note: SageTV Submenus are still supported and can be used with ADM except in the new QLM feature
    * Previous Users of ADM: if you have minor modifications to your ADM menus then I recommend loading the Default Menus with this version and then applying your minor modifications again.  This will allow you to take full advantage of showing/hiding all menu items as well as use the new QLM feature.  If you have larger modifications and your current menus are working well for you then there is no need to change as this version is fully backwards compatible.
  * ADM Manager option buttons (left side) now scrollable when required
  * Other minor fixes

== Changes in Version 0.40 ==

  * New User Based Menu Item control
    * Block the display of Menu Items based on SageTV User Profiles

  * ADM Manager
    * Menu Items can now be reordered in either of the List by modes (Structured/Grouped)
    * Options item updated to allow configuring the Max items to be displayed on each level before scrolling starts
  * Other minor fixes

== Getting Started ==

  * Works with SageTV 7.1.9 
  
  * available as a "UI Mod" plugin under SageTV version 7+ called "ADM - Another Dynamic Menu"
  * works with Standard SageTV as well as with Diamond (see Diamond section below)
  * ADM Manager is always available from the Main Menu Options menu
  * How it works
    * on initial load ADM will load either a Standard Sage menu item list or a Diamond list if Diamond is detected
    * ADM uses the Standard SageTV "Menu System" to display a dynamic list of user customizable Menu Items
    * the menu Look and Feel is not ADM's - as it uses this from SageTV
    * you can add, delete, hide any Menu Item or even start from scratch (Delete ALL) and build an entire new custom Menu
    * if you "mess up" you can always load the default menus and start again
    * the menu items are saved in the Sage .properties file but can be Exported and Imported from other clients

  ==== Action Management ====
    ||[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMActionManager.JPG http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMActionManager-ppc.JPG] _Action Manager_ ||[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMActionManagerFiltered.JPG http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMActionManagerFiltered-ppc.JPG] _Filtered_ || _click to view_ ||
    
    * Selecting an Action
      * Select from a list of Actions on the right hand side - approximately 120 different actions available as of 0.42
      * The selected Action will launch when the Menu Item is selected within the SageTV menu system
      * If more information is needed from the user then another dialog may open. See [#Special_Action_Types]
    * Filtering the Action List
      * The left hand side contains Action Categories that can be used to filter the right hand Action List
      * The default is that all Actions are listed - Not Filtered - 
      * One filter can be enabled at a time
      * Filters toggle between the following states
        * Off - by default - radio button is disabled - no filtering for this item
        * On - radio button is enabled - the list is filtered by this Action Category
        * Sticky - radio button is enabled - text is displayed in red - the list is filtered by this Action Category
        * Sticky - a sticky item will still be selected the next time the Action dialog is opened.  This is handy when creating a number of menu items for the same category of actions, such as TV or Music.

  ==== Special Action Types ====

    * Execute Widget by Symbol (Advanced mode only)
      * Offers a text entry box to type a Widget Symbol to use for the Menu Item Action
      * The Symbol entered will be validated against SageTV to ensure it exists.
      * Note: not all Widget Symbols can be used as a valid action. So even if it exists does not mean it will give you the desired results.  Use with caution.
      * The entered Widget Symbol will execute when the Menu Item is selected within the SageTV menu system

    * Video Browser with specific Folder
      ||[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMVideoFolders.JPG http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMVideoFolders-ppc.JPG] _Video Folders_ ||[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMVideoFoldersSetFolder.JPG http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMVideoFoldersSetFolder-ppc.JPG] _Set Folder_ || _click to view_ ||

        * Set this option and enter a valid Folder and this menu item will jump to that specific folder when selected
        * The Folder entered must be exactly as displayed in the Videos by Folder screen next to Folder:
      [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMVideoFoldersPath.JPG http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMVideoFoldersPath-ppc.JPG] _click to view_
        * The Folder name is case sensitive and should have the trailing "/" or "\"
        * Note: SageTV uses a different process for the Path between Separate and Combined Folder settings. If you have a working Video Folder menu item and change the Combined/Separate Video Folder setting the menu item may not go to the proper Folder and may need to be edited.
        * see [#ADM_Copy_Mode] for information on creating this action type through a Copy function
      
    * Launch Specific TV Recordings View
      * Select from a list of SageTV built in Recordings Views
      * The selected Recordings View will launch when the Menu Item is selected within the SageTV menu system
      * Special features
        * After selecting a Recordings View you may be prompted to Rename the View or the Menu Item so they match
        * The View name is always displayed at the Top Left of the Recordings View
        * Renaming the view is at the SageTV level and is the same as using the Rename function in the Menu Options while displaying the specific Recordings View
        * If you change the Display Name for the Menu Item you may also be prompted to rename either the Menu Item or the Recordings View so they match.
        * You will have the option to leave them names differently
      * see [#ADM_Copy_Mode] for information on creating this action type through a Copy function

    * File Browser: Local/Server/Imports/Network/Recordings
      ||[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMFileBrowserMenuItem.JPG http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMFileBrowserMenuItem-ppc.JPG] _File Browser Item_ ||[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMFileBrowserResult.JPG http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMFileBrowserResult-ppc.JPG] _File Browser_ || _click to view_ ||

        * Set this option and enter a valid Path and this menu item will jump to that specific Path when selected
        * The Path entered is free form and will not be validated, but if invalid will result in a Path Not Found error in the File Browser
        * Use the ADM Copy Mode to improve accuracy when creating this type of action
        * The following File Browser Action Types are available to support the similar File Browser
          * Local - local file system browser
          * Server - browses the file system on the SageTV Server
          * Network - specific Network browse functions
          * Imports - browser for SageTV Import Paths
          * Recordings - browser for SageTV Recording Directories
          * Note: many of these are "interchangeable" in that they act similarily and may launch the same Action Path as another type.  The main difference will be seen after launching the Menu Item and getting to the Path the different types may present different Options and Back button behavior.  Experiment with the Action Types to get your desired resutls.

    * Launch External Application

    * Children
      * assigned by creating Submenu items on a Parent Menu Item
      * changing a Menu Item's Parent will make the current Menu Item a Child of that Parent. (it will also remove any Submenu settings for the Parent)
    * Submenus
      * assigned by setting a Menu Item's Submenu setting in the Edit dialog
      * if a Menu Item has Children assigned then the Submenu setting is not offered.  You must delete the Children first.
  
== Plugin Compatibilities ==
=== General ===
  * any Plugin that modifies the Main Menus or their submenus may have issues and should be tested
  * I can add notes here for any reported issues, workarounds or succeses
  * If you need temporary access to a Menu that is missing then you can go to the ADM Manager and Disable ADM and the function should operate normally with the standard SageTV Menus
  
=== Diamond ===
  * see [#Diamond_Notes]

=== MyTV ===
  * Should work with ADM disabled
  * Tested with Diamond MyTV
  * ADM Enabled
    * Add a custom Submenu (2nd level menu) and specify the MyTV submenu as it's Sage Submenu
