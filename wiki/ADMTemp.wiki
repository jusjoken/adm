== Getting Started ==

  * Works with SageTV 7.1.9 
  
  * available as a "UI Mod" plugin under SageTV version 7+ called "ADM - Another Dynamic Menu"
  * works with Standard SageTV as well as with Diamond (see Diamond section below)
  * ADM Manager is always available from the Main Menu Options menu
  * How it works
    * on initial load ADM will load either a Standard Sage menu item list or a Diamond list if Diamond is detected
    * ADM uses the Standard SageTV "Menu System" to display a dynamic list of user customizable Menu Items
    * the menu Look and Feel is not ADM's - as it uses this from SageTV
    * you can add, delete, hide any Menu Item or even start from scratch (Delete ALL) and build an entire new custom Menu
    * if you "mess up" you can always load the default menus and start again
    * the menu items are saved in the Sage .properties file but can be Exported and Imported from other clients

== !ToDo List ==
  * Check this list out if you are "wondering" if a new feature is planned for ADM
    * Launch an external program is being considered - need some user feedback on what this would be used for and expected results.
    * Other user suggestions if a feature is missing

      * The entered Widget Symbol will execute when the Menu Item is selected within the SageTV menu system

    * Video Browser with specific Folder
      ||[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMVideoFolders.JPG http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMVideoFolders-ppc.JPG] _Video Folders_ ||[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMVideoFoldersSetFolder.JPG http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7826058/ADM/ADMVideoFoldersSetFolder-ppc.JPG] _Set Folder_ || _click to view_ ||

        * The Folder name is case sensitive and should have the trailing "/" or "\"
        * Note: SageTV uses a different process for the Path between Separate and Combined Folder settings. If you have a working Video Folder menu item and change the Combined/Separate Video Folder setting the menu item may not go to the proper Folder and may need to be edited.

    * Launch Specific TV Recordings View
      * Select from a list of SageTV built in Recordings Views

        * The View name is always displayed at the Top Left of the Recordings View
        * Renaming the view is at the SageTV level and is the same as using the Rename function in the Menu Options while displaying the specific Recordings View
        * If you change the Display Name for the Menu Item you may also be prompted to rename either the Menu Item or the Recordings View so they match.
        * You will have the option to leave them names differently

        * Set this option and enter a valid Path and this menu item will jump to that specific Path when selected
        * The Path entered is free form and will not be validated, but if invalid will result in a Path Not Found error in the File Browser
        * Use the ADM Copy Mode to improve accuracy when creating this type of action
        * The following File Browser Action Types are available to support the similar File Browser
          * Local - local file system browser

The main difference will be seen after launching the Menu Item and getting to the Path the different types may present different Options and Back button behavior.  Experiment with the Action Types to get your desired resutls.

    * Children
      * assigned by creating Submenu items on a Parent Menu Item
      * changing a Menu Item's Parent will make the current Menu Item a Child of that Parent. (it will also remove any Submenu settings for the Parent)
    * Submenus
      * assigned by setting a Menu Item's Submenu setting in the Edit dialog
      * if a Menu Item has Children assigned then the Submenu setting is not offered.  You must delete the Children first.
  
== Plugin Compatibilities ==
=== General ===
  * any Plugin that modifies the Main Menus or their submenus may have issues and should be tested
  * I can add notes here for any reported issues, workarounds or succeses
  * If you need temporary access to a Menu that is missing then you can go to the ADM Manager and Disable ADM and the function should operate normally with the standard SageTV Menus
  
=== Diamond ===
  * see [#Diamond_Notes]

=== MyTV ===
  * Should work with ADM disabled
  * Tested with Diamond MyTV
  * ADM Enabled
    * Add a custom Submenu (2nd level menu) and specify the MyTV submenu as it's Sage Submenu
    * The Auto Open function will not work yet (perhaps in a future release)

=== Other Plugins ===

  * Replace videos with Diamond Movies
    * This function of Diamond will not affect the visibility of the Video or Movies menu item. You must set this manually within ADM Manager using the Show Menu Item property.
  * Hide Main Menu Items
    * This function of Diamond will not affect the visibility of the Main Menu items. You must set these manually within ADM Manager using the Show Menu Item property.
  * Background Images
    * Some Diamond themes use a single image for all Top Level menus so selecting a Background image will not affect the Diamond Menus
    * Custom Backgrounds can be added and assigned to override this Diamond behaviour
  * Diamond Movies - Custom and Default Flows
    * Action types available to launch specific Default and Custom Flows
  * TV Views
    * TV Recordings views which Diamond uses are standard SageTV Recordings View with added customizations
    * These views can be launched from any ADM Menu Item (as of ADM 0.36+)
    * ADM Copy mode can be used to create these Menu Items as well
  * Future !ToDos to support Diamond

      * Now ADM is Disabled
      * Press HOME and the Sage Standard menus will be shown
      * Follow these steps to re-enable ADM when you are done
  * Loading Default Menus
    * go to the ADM Manager
    * select Load Default Menus

  * Clear All ADM Settings
    * If all else fails then look here to [#Clear_All_ADM_Settings]
  * Where are the Imports/Exports
